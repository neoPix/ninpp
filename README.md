#Ninpp

Ninpp is an HTML5 presentation system. It works on all modern browsers and allows you to create greate ans structured presentations that can easily be published online. You can also record yourself when your performing the presentation and publish it afterward on the web with the packaged audio/video.

##Start using it now

You can start using this system now. The presentation part only require an updated browser. The video/audio convertion and presentation preparation part currently require a linux operating system to function properly.

##Why ?

I had to prepare a talk about a random subject for school. I just finished a week of a course on Linux, GNU and free softwares so i did not wanted to use PowerPoint, I'm not good with Libre Office either so i figured out :

>"Let's make an HTML presentation"

I loked at other existing systems, and since i had some technologies i wanted to try out (mostly HTML5). So i created my own.

##Technologies

Client side :

* WebComponents (XTags)
* WebRTC (video recording)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript

Server side :

* ffmpeg

##Todo

* Create the **Artki** platform allowing to create presentations in the browser.
